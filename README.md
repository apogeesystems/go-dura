# go-dura
[Tim Kellogg's Dura](https://github.com/tkellogg/dura) but written in Go

I encourage anyone with Rust knowledge to contribute to his project and use this great tool.

The main purpose for this effort is to provide the same (or at least very similar) functionality as Tim Kellogg's Dura but in a version written in Golang. As I am less familiar with Rust as I am with Go I wanted to prevent the need to download yet another host of applications/tools/compilers/etc. to use his tool.

Initial working version is TBD but should be coming soon. Many thanks to Tim Kellogg and the internet for supplying us with Dura.
