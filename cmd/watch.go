If more than one path is provided, the include, exclude and max-depth watch configuration settings will be applied to each of the repositories provided.
If the force flag is not provided the CLI will prompt for the user to accept these changes.

This function loops through the paths provided one-by-one calling the appropriate watch command which returns an error each time, the paths will be accessed in the 
order they were provided but if one should produce an error, and the skip flag was not provided, the entire CLI will exit. Additionally, for each watch command execution, the configuration file is 
written and then re-read this is due to the fact that this command should *usually* be executed once per repository but the added functionality to specify more is
for convenience.`,
